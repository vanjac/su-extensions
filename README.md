A handful of useful extensions for SketchUp. Tested with SketchUp Make 2017 on Windows.

- Fly Tool
- Hide Back Faces (back-face culling)
- Dynamic Animations: extends animation capabilities of Dynamic Components

`install.ps1` can be used to install all plugins for SketchUp 2017 (you will need to restart SketchUp). You can modify the script if you have a different version.
